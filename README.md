## Now for the Python studies to pass the exam
While we talk about the world chaning ideas, we need to pass the exam first. So, let's start with the requirements.
### Final Full-Stack with Python Project (max grade 10)
#### Functionality:
- Register
- Log in
- Create a new category (only when logged in)
- Edit a category (only when logged in)
- Delete a category (only when logged in)
- Create a new note (only when logged in)
- A note should have a title and note text.
- There should also be an option to add images to the note.
- It should allow assigning the note to a specific category.
- Edit a note (only when logged in)
- Delete a note (only when logged in)
- Search for notes by title (only when logged in)
- Filter notes by category (only when logged in)


## Technology Stack
This private project is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a scalable architecture, leveraging Amazon EC2 for application deployment, Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for database management, and Route 53 for domain management. To handle large storage requirements, images are stored on a cost-effective SAS/NAS server, ensuring affordability for massive datasets exceeding 100 TB.



## Features

📚 Extensive Database: Detailed information and specifications for coins, banknotes, postage stamps, cameras, and more.

🖼️ Massive Image Library: High-quality images hosted on an SAS/NAS server for cost-efficient storage.

🔍 Search & Filter: Robust search and filtering capabilities for narrowing down collectibles.

🗂️ Category Organization: Collectibles organized by categories, periods, and types.

🌐 Scalable Infrastructure: Hosted on AWS with support for high traffic and large datasets.


## Architecture
**Application Hosting**: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) with Docker containers

**Database**: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for scalable and managed database services. Database architecture is here: https://dbdiagram.io/d/demony-66f94cab3430cb846cf8bee0

**Domain**: amadesa.com via Amazon Route 53 (DNS management)

**Storage**: Images stored on SAS/NAS servers for cost-effective large-scale storage. (not implemented yet)





## Installation (Development Environment, for you my dear reader!)

To set up the project locally. We will call it **storefront***:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hobbyofkings/storefront.git
   cd storefront

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
3. **Install dependencies:**
if you are willing to deploy it to ubuntu server, please mute 'psycopg2' or change it to 'psycopg2-binary' in the requirements.txt file because it may cause some issues with the installation on the ubuntu server.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

if you forget to mute 'psycopg2' or change it to 'psycopg2-binary' in the requirements.txt file, you can write this command

```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```
and this one
```bash
while read line; do
    if [[ $line != *"psycopg2"* ]]; then
        pip install "$line"
    fi
done < requirements.txt
```




   
4. **Setup Environment Variables: Create a two .env files (.env and .env.dev) in the main app folder inside settings (storefront/settings) with the following configuration:**

Disclaimer:
We keep the environment variables in a separate file to keep the code clean and secure. The .env file is used to store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and other secrets. It is not uploaded to the repository. The .env.dev file is used for development, and the .env file is used for production.
this is env.dev file
   ```bash
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=storefront.settings.dev
   DATABASE_NAME=amadesadb_local
   DATABASE_USER=postgres
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=Password
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DEBUG=True
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-development-secret-key
   LOG_DIR=logs  # Use a relative path for local logs, e.g., a folder in your project
   ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=78.62.144.136,127.0.0.1 # Add your IP address for the Django admin panel or delete this line to allow all IPs
   ```

this is env file (for production, it configures the database to connect to the RDS, AWS). If you dont have RDS, you can use the same configuration as in the env.dev file. In my case, I have RDS, so I need to configure the database to connect to the RDS.
   ```bash
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=storefront.settings.prod
   DATABASE_NAME=amadesadb
   DATABASE_USER=amadesa
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=Password
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   DEBUG=False # Set to False for production
   DATABASE_HOST=amadesadb.xxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-go-here
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxx
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxx
   LOG_DIR=logs
   ALLOWED_ADMIN_IPS=78.62.144.136,127.0.0.1 # Add your IP address for the Django admin panel or delete this line to allow all IPs
   ```
  
5. **Apply migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
   
  
6. **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
   

7. set up the static files
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic

8. **Set the environment variable:**
before starting the server we need to set the environment variable (it will be used to load the correct settings file)
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_ENV=development
   echo $DJANGO_ENV
   ```

9. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
   
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Congratulations! The project is now up and running. You can check the admin panel at /admin/ and log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.
Please take a look to Django documentation for more information about the project structure and how to work with Django.

## Deployment: Production on AWS (For those planning AWS ECS and RDS Deployment)
Deploying a project to AWS ECS and RDS is a significant endeavor, requiring careful planning, configuration, and research. While this particular project might not be life-changing, deploying it properly demands time and effort. Below, you'll find an outline of the steps involved in preparing and deploying the project to AWS. Please note, this is not an exhaustive guide, and you'll need to dive deeper into specific topics as you proceed.

### Steps for AWS Deployment:
1. Prepare the Project for Production:
- Ensure the project is fully configured for production use, including setting DEBUG=False in Django settings.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information such as database credentials and secret keys.
- Configure static files and media storage (consider using S3 for production or other cloud storage services or if you are smart and you have huge ambitions, you can use SAS/NAS servers for cost-effective large-scale storage).

2. Set Up AWS Services:
- Create an RDS instance to host your PostgreSQL database.
- Set up an ECS cluster to manage your Dockerized application.
- Use Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) to store your Docker images.
3. Containerization:

- Ensure the project is containerized using Docker.
- Build and push your Docker images to the ECR repository. 

4. Task Definition and Service Configuration:

- Create ECS task definitions for your services (e.g., Django app and Nginx).
- Configure an ECS service to handle task scaling and placement.
5. Networking:

- Set up a VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure secure communication between ECS, RDS, and any other AWS resources.
- Configure a load balancer (ALB) for handling incoming traffic and directing it to ECS tasks.


6. Domain and SSL:

- Use Route 53 to manage your domain's DNS records.
- Configure SSL certificates using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for secure HTTPS connections.

7. Monitoring and Logging:

- Enable CloudWatch for monitoring application performance and logging.
- Set up alarms and notifications for critical events.
8. Deployment Process:

- Use AWS CLI, SDKs, or infrastructure as code tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to automate deployment.
- Test the deployment thoroughly in a staging environment before promoting it to production.
9. Post-Deployment Steps:

- Monitor application performance and address any issues promptly.
- Implement scaling policies to handle variable traffic loads.

While this overview highlights the essential steps, you’ll need to conduct detailed research and adapt the process to fit the specific needs of your project. AWS documentation and chatGPT are excellent resources to guide you through this madness. Good luck!

## Steps to connect to the server (Ubuntu) | Update the server | Run the project


1. ### Connect to the server:
to do this properly I am using the SSH key, so I need to send the key to the server first. My SSH is saved in my desktop, so I need to send it to the server. I am using the scp command to send the key to the server.

```bash
scp -i "C:\Users\Kompiuteris\Desktop\SSH\amadesa.pem" "C:\Users\Kompiuteris\Desktop\SSH\amadesa.pem" ubuntu@67.202.22.239:~
 ```
now I can connect to the server using the SSH key. Ip address is the public IP address of the server.
    
```bash
ssh -i "C:\Users\Kompiuteris\Desktop\SSH\amadesa.pem" ubuntu@67.202.22.239
   ```
Congrats! now you are connected to the Ubuntu server. it should look like this:
    
```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-87-241:~$
   ```

2. ### Update the system (Ubuntu):
to update the system, I need to run the following commands:
    
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```
3. ### Activate the virtual environment:
to activate the virtual environment, I need to run the following commands:
    
```bash
cd ~/storefront
source venv/bin/activate
   ```

if the django server is running we can check the status of the server using the following command:
    
```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
   ```
if not working, try this one:
        
```bash
   ps aux | grep gunicorn
   ```

logs can be checked using the following command:
    
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/syslog
  ```
        
to check if tmux is running

```bash
    ps aux | grep tmux
```

```bash
tmux new-session -s gunicorn
   ```
to attach to the session
        
```bash
    tmux attach-session -t gunicorn
  ```
to detach from the session**
        
```bash
    Ctrl+b, then d
  ```

list of all tmux sessions
        
```bash
    tmux list-sessions
  ```

## run gunicon server in the tmux session
to start the gunicorn server, I need to run the following command:
    
```bash
  /home/ubuntu/storefront/venv/bin/gunicorn --env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=storefront.settings.prod storefront.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --log-level debug --workers 3
  ```

## Github updates
to update the project from the github, I need to run the following commands:
    
```bash
cd ~/storefront
git pull origin amazon
  ```
if there are any changes, I need to restart the gunicorn server using the following command:
        
```bash
    sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```










1. Run Server with Gunicorn:
    ```bash          
    gunicorn --env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=storefront.settings.prod storefront.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 3

2. NGINX Configuration: 

    Configure **/etc/nginx/sites-available/amadesa.com** to serve as a reverse proxy.
  
3. Database Connection:

    ```bash
    psql -h amadesadb.cp8a808oguxu.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U amadesa -d amadesadb -p 5432

4. Certbot SSL:

    ```bash 
    sudo certbot --nginx -d amadesa.com -d www.amadesa.com
   

5. Docker Images and ECS:

    Build Docker images:
    
   ```bash   
    docker-compose up --build  

   
**Tag and push to Amazon ECR:**


    ```bash  

    docker tag app:latest 479296291493.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/django2:latest

## Database commands (RDS and Postgres)
***RDS (Relational Database Service)*** is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

to test if database is running (Amazon RDS)
```bash
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName amadesadb.cp8a808oguxu.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -Port 5432
 ```

to connect to database
    
   ```bash
    psql -h amadesadb.cp8a808oguxu.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U amadesa -d amadesadb -p 5432
  ```


### For development (local database)
to start from scratch with the Postgres database using terminal
we need to login to enter the Postgres shell
   ```bash
    psql -U postgres    
   ```
to create a new user (username will be postgres)
   ```bash
   
    CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   ```

to create a new database

   ```bash
    CREATE DATABASE amadesadb_local WITH OWNER postgres;
  ```
   
      
to grant all privileges to the user
```bash
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE amadesadb_local TO postgres;
 ```
    
to connect to the database
```bash
    \c amadesadb_local
  ```

 



### Postgres commands
list all databases

   ```bash
    \l
  ```
list all tables in a database

   ```bash
    \c amadesadb
    \dt
  ```
list all columns in a table

   ```bash
    \d+ foundation_country
  ```

list all rows in a table

   ```bash
    SELECT * FROM foundation_country;
  ```



      
    
    



## Github commands
   ```bash   
   git pull origin amazon
   git stash
   git stash apply
   
   ```

## Linux (ubuntu commands)

update the system
```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
 ```


## Django commands


to create a new project
```bash
    django-admin startproject storefront
  ```

create superuser
```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

to create a new app
```bash   
    python manage.py startapp storefront
  ```

After creating a new app, add the app to the installed apps in the settings.py file
```bash   
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'storefront',
    ]
  ```
we create a new model in the storefront/models.py file
Django will create a table in the database for this model automatically
It will do a lot of behind the scenes work like creating a table, creating a primary key, creating a foreign key, etc.
Create a model for coins

```bash   
    class Coin(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        description = models.TextField()
        year = models.IntegerField()
        country = models.ForeignKey(Country, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        denomination = models.ForeignKey(Denomination, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        metal = models.ForeignKey(Metal, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        weight = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
        diameter = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
        thickness = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
        obverse = models.ImageField(upload_to='coins/')
        reverse = models.ImageField(upload_to='coins/')
        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
  ```

to apply the changes
```bash   
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
  ```
views are used to handle the request and return the response
create a view in the storefront/views.py file
lets create a health check view (Amazons health check service will check this view to see if the server is running)
```bash   
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    def health_check(request):
        return HttpResponse('OK')
  ```
to create a url for the view
create a new file in the storefront folder called urls.py
```bash   
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
        path('health/', views.health_check),
    ]
  ```
to include the urls in the main project
add the following line to the urlpatterns in the storefront/urls.py file
```bash   
    path('', include('storefront.urls')),
  ```
to run the server
```bash   
    python manage.py runserver
  ```
**to check the health check view**
endpoint ends with health_check, example: https://amadesa.com/health/
in local development, the endpoint will be http://


to check the admin panel
endpoint ends with /admin, example: http://amadesa.com/admin/
